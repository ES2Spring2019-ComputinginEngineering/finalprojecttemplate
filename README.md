# This is your Final Project ReadMe Template

The file is inside your final project repository called "README.md"

You should include in your final project readme a description of the project, a list of all the files that you have created and instructions for use.

This readme is written in a language called markdown. This is not a programming language but a formatting langauge. There are symbols (syntax) used to indicate how to format the text. For example the pound symbol (i.e. the hashtag) is used to format a title; two of the same symbol format a heading, and three format a sub-heading.

Below is some example text in markdown however this alone is not sufficient for the final project. **Make sure you follow the directions on Canvas.**

Delete the instructions above this line and the line:
